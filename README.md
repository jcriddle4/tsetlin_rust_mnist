# A Fast Tsetlin Machine Implementation Employing Bit-Wise Operators
An implementation of the Tsetlin Machine (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01508) using bitwise operations for increased learning- and classification speed.

Recoded from C to Rust. Original code and documentation can be found at https://github.com/cair/fast-tsetlin-machine-with-mnist-demo
Added the ability to run multithreaded. Added a genetic combination thing that may or may not be helpful. 
This code expects to run on a 64bit machine.
